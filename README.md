# Simple-UNIX-Shell
This is a very simple UNIX shell written in C for the Operating Systems course at the University of South Florida. It runs most of the basic LINUX/UNIX shell commands and can be compiled by dropping both the sh.c and Makefile into a LINUX/UNIX directory and typing ```make``` followed by ```./sh```.
